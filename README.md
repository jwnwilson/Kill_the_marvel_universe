Kill the marvel universe for reals this time

Plan of attack:

- Build simple scraper with grequests for character API use comic IDs as that's all we need save data into characters.json (check comic ID limit doesn't break anything)

- Write a simple reporter to output all characters alphabetically

- Write simple reporter to output top 10 heros by comics

- Build a networkx graph using comic IDs to connect heros in graph

- Use networkx to calculate centrality and get top 10

- Use community to work out the communities in the marvel universe and then find the most connected community bridges that will cover the most communities

- Show reasons for going for community links based on research that they are the ones who need to be vaccinated first inepidemics to fight them. 

- Kill the bastards
